# Analyzing Yelp

## Introduction
In this project, Group 4 will be analyzing Yelp data from metropolitan areas in the states of Washington, Illinois, and New York. We have only included zip codes in these states that have a population greater than 10,001 in order to narrow down our search of 4 and 5-star restaurants. The questions we are trying to answer include:
  - What is the connection between 4 and 5-star reviews and restaurant prices?
  - What cuisines have the highest overall ratings?
  - Are there different prices that certain age groups are willing to pay?
 
 We are currently exploring other questions, such as:
  - Where is the highest count of reviews?
  - What price point has the highest vs the lowest count of reviews?
  - Is there are category with a higher or lower count of reviews?
  - What determines the number of stars? (Machine Learning)
  - What determines the price? (Machine Learning)
  - Median income in different areas for visualization on determinates of price. Histogram, box plot. histogram - how price/income is distributed. box plot to show range of incomes.
  - stacked bar graph for combined age income distribution
